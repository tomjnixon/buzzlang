A Turing complete<sup>1</sup> synergy-oriented programming language for your everyday business needs!

Install
=======

You'll need at least `ghc`, `haskell-parsec` and `cabal-install`.

To install, run

	cabal install --prefix=$HOME --user

in the current directory.

This will install the interpreter, called `buzz`.

<sub><sup>1</sup> probably.</sub>
