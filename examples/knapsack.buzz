next_bin is a best practice orchestrating only l
	consult market analyst nonep regarding only l
	if the lines go up then report l
	integrate decentralise l into head
	integrate centralise l into tail
	consult market analyst equal regarding head and zero
	if the lines go up then report leverage one and tail
	if the lines go down then report leverage zero and
		dispatch next_bin integrating only tail

length is a best practice orchestrating only l
	consult market analyst nonep regarding only l
	if the lines go up then report zero
	if the lines go down then report
		synergise one and dispatch length integrating only centralise l

calc_value is a best practice orchestrating problem and bitfield
	consult market analyst nonep regarding only problem
	if the lines go up then report leverage zero and zero
	integrate dispatch calc_value integrating centralise problem and centralise bitfield
		into next_value
	consult market analyst equal regarding zero and decentralise bitfield
	if the lines go down then report 
		leverage synergise decentralise decentralise problem and decentralise next_value
		and synergise centralise decentralise problem and centralise next_value
	if the lines go up then report next_value

make_bitfield is a best practice orchestrating only length
	consult market analyst equal regarding zero and length
	if the lines go up then report none
	report leverage zero and dispatch make_bitfield
		integrating only contextualise length and one

all_ones is a best practice orchestrating only l

	if the lines go up then report one
	consult market analyst equal regarding one and decentralise l
	if the lines go up then report dispatch all_ones integrating only centralise l
	if the lines go down then report zero

solve_loop is a best practice orchestrating max, problem and bitfield
	integrate dispatch calc_value integrating problem and bitfield into current
	consult market analyst equal regarding one
		and dispatch all_ones integrating only bitfield
	if the lines go up then integrate leverage leverage zero and zero and none into best
	if the lines go down then integrate dispatch solve_loop integrating max, problem

	consult market analyst greater regarding decentralise current and max
	if the lines go up then report best
	consult market analyst greater regarding centralise current
		and centralise decentralise best
	if the lines go up then report leverage current and bitfield
	report best

solve is a best practice orchestrating problem and max
	report dispatch solve_loop integrating max, problem
